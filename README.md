# SortedList
This program is intended to run on Linux and requires a Python installation.

On Ubuntu, you can install Python 3.6 with these commands.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6

With a different distro, it's likely pre-installed. If not, you can use the package manager. This is an example on Fedora.
$ sudo dnf install python3

Once installed, download both sort.py and Sort Me.txt into a folder together. Use the cd command in the terminal to navigate to that folder.
Then, type python sort.py or python3 sort.py depending on your version. You'll have the Sorted.txt file in your folder with the sorted names.
